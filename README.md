<h1>Active Directory Lab</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This project showcases my ability to create and manage a fully functional Active Directory (AD) environment, simulating a real-world IT infrastructure. Using Oracle VirtualBox, I built a virtual lab to practice and learn critical IT skills, including user management, domain configuration, network configuration and helpdesk troubleshooting.</p>

<p>In this project, I'll be setting up a lab environment using Windows Server 2016 and a few Windows 10 virtual machines. Windows Server 2016 will be used as the domain controller and it will enable the creation, authentication, and authorization of users that I create within AD. My end goal is to familiarise myself with Active Directory, learning its functions and the benefits it offers.</p>

- <b>Active Directory Users and Computers</b> 
- <b>Server Manager</b>
- <b>Command Prompt</b> 
- <b>Control Panel</b>
- <b>Remote Desktop Connection</b>
- <b>File Explorer</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

<p align="center">This is the first step in this project. I’ve installed the software called “ORACLE VIRTUALBOX” and this software will allow me to install and manage virtual devices on my laptop. Using this software will allow me to create a small network in which I will create a domain and that domain will include a server and some clients. I will also be able to use “Active Directory” to manage users and computers.</p>

<p align="center">The next step is to click where it says “NEW”. This function will allow me to add a virtual client inside the software “VirtualBox”. In this case, I will try to add “Windows Server 2016” which will be used for active directory, to create a domain and manage all clients on the domain.</p>
