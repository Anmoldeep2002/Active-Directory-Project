<h1>Active Directory Lab</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This project showcases my ability to create and manage a fully functional Active Directory (AD) environment, simulating a real-world IT infrastructure. Using Oracle VirtualBox, I built a virtual lab to practice and learn critical IT skills, including user management, domain configuration, network configuration and helpdesk troubleshooting.</p>

<p>In this project, I'll be setting up a lab environment using Windows Server 2016 and a few Windows 10 virtual machines. Windows Server 2016 will be used as the domain controller and it will enable the creation, authentication, and authorization of users that I create within AD. My end goal is to familiarise myself with Active Directory, learning its functions and the benefits it offers.</p>
